Mark is a man who was raised in a community of people who all shared similar moral beliefs. Growing up, he was taught to believe that all homosexual people were inferior and that he had a moral right to mistreat them.<br>As an adult, Mark never reflected on the values he had been taught in his upbringing and never asked himself, "What kind of person do I want to be?" Without further reflection, Mark became a proud LGBTQI+ activist and believed that all people were equal and had a right to be treated with dignity and respect.<br>At the age of 35, Mark moved to another town. Walking outside his home, he sees a homosexual couple kissing goodbye at a house entrance. One of the men returns into the house, the other man starts walking along the street. When the man’s keys fall out of his pocket unnoticed, Mark picks up the keys, catches up to the man and hands them back. After wishing the man a nice day, Mark continues walking.

Without further reflection, Mark became a proud homophobe and believed that all homosexual people were inferior and that he had a moral right to mistreat them.<br>At the age of 35, Mark moved to another town. Walking outside his home, he sees a homosexual couple kissing goodbye at a house entrance. One of the men returns into the house, the other man starts walking along the street.

[[ID:freeWill]] 
In philosophy, there is a long-standing debate about whether humans have free will or if our actions are determined by prior causes (such as biology or the laws of nature). Philosophical determinism is the belief that all events and actions are determined by causes beyond our control. Free will is the belief that humans have the capacity to choose their actions independently. How would you describe your own view on this? On a scale from 1 (philosophical determinism) to 7 (free will), where would you place yourself?
