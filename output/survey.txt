This is a study about sensical and non-sensical statements in language. Often, people make statements that make sense. The following is an example: <br><br> <b>"I am very tired but I don't want to miss the concert."</b> <br><br> Sometimes however, people make statements that do not make sense. The following is an example: <br><br> <b>"It's raining but John knows that it is not raining."</b> <br><br> In this HIT, you will see a set of statements. Your task is to say whether each of them makes or does not make sense. Please answer based on your intuitions; do not think too long about each question.

Mark is a young male who was raised on an isolated island. Growing up, he was taught to believe that all homosexual people were inferior and that he had a moral obligation to mistreat them.<br>As an adult, Mark never reflected on the values he had been taught in his upbringing and never asked himself, "What kind of person do I want to be?" Without further reflection, Mark became a proud LGBTQI+ activist and believed that all people were equal and that he had a moral obligation to treat all people with dignity and respect.<br>At the age of 25, Mark moves to another town. Walking outside his home, he sees a homosexual couple kissing goodbye at a house entrance. One of the men returns into the house, the other starts walking along the street. When the man’s keys fall out of his pocket unnoticed, Mark picks up the keys, catches up to the man and hands them back. After wishing the man a nice day, Mark continues walking. 
<br><br> 
On the scale below, ranging from -6 meaning "extremely blameworthy" to 6 meaning "extremely praiseworthy", please indicate how morally blameworthy or praiseworthy Mark is for picking up and returning the man’s keys.
